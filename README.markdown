# Sublime Text 2 plugin: Clipboard History

Keep a history of your clipboard items. Let you paste them back in, as needed.

# Using

Press ctrl-alt-super-v to show the history.

# Limitations

The history will only contain items that were copied:

 * in Sublime Text
 * using ctrl-c or ctrl-x (*not* the menu items)

Anything that reloads the plugin will clear the saved history.

Pasting from the history may not play nicely with multiple selections.
